<h1> REST-API Typescript </h1>

<h2>What is Typescript?</h2>
<p>TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale. Src: https://www.typescriptlang.org/</p>

<h2>What is REST API?</h2>
<p>An API, or application programming interface, is a set of rules that define how applications or devices can connect to and communicate with each other. A REST API is an API that conforms to the design principles of the REST, or representational state transfer architectural style. For this reason, REST APIs are sometimes referred to RESTful APIs.

<h2>Now what's in this repository?</h2>
<p>This repository contains a source REST API using the Typescript programming language. In this repo, I created a REST API in which there is a data product "Songket Silungkang" connected to MongoDB. In the flow of creating this REST API I also integrate with POSTMAN.</p>
